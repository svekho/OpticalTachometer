# Optical_Tachometer

Optical Tachometer uses visible light to detect and calculate RPM of spinning propellor.

Basic version introduces tachometer usage with 7-segment display, which updates only the most significant digit of RPM twice a second. DC motor control with a potentiometer is attached in version bonus1. Bonus2 version displays RPM with LCD display, which updates once a second. 

In version FINAL, all versions are combined as one. The code under version FINAL has been parsed to project's closure form.
